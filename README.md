# Yeast Beast
Garry's Mod's first alcohol production addon on the market.

## What is Yeast Beast?
It was first addon to cover moonshine production more in depth. It allows to create mash, ferment it and distil it. It was originally sold on GMS but became free as I didn't have enough time to provide proper support expected from paid product.

## Warning
This adddon is pretty outdated, should still work, but I do not provide any support due to the fact I mentioned above.
